This folder contains codes needed to run the experiments.

To run the experiement, run the file 'experiments.py'.

The path for the input files, 'cdc_matrix' and 'MobData_all' are set in the file 'utils.py', please change them accordingly.
The output path for the results is also set in the file 'utils.py', please change it accordingly.

Available models can be found in the file 'models.py', in order to save some time, 
please run one model each time, the model can be changed in the file 'experiments.py'.

We suggest that running the experiements on Google Colab and using Google's GPU to save time.

Raw data and the codes for data preprocessing are also available,
but we do not recommend to run it, as it takes two full days to 
process the data with two people running in parallel in Google Colab.

If there is any issue or question, please contact us.
